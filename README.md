# autoLabelTool
A simple but effective automatic annotation tool with a flexible customisable detector for pixel level annotation accuracy 

## Installation 

### 1: go to main folder

```bash
cd ./autoLabelTool
make 
```

### 2: Run benchmark on you own pc:
In folder benchmark a simple script is provided to run readcvYaml on your own data.
Simply choose the number of iterations with N parameter and run benchmarktest_cvYaml.m. The benchmark was performed for 5x[1000x3] double, 5x[2000x3] float, 5x[2000x3] int, and 5x[3000] double, 5x[6000] float and 5x[6000] int vectors. See test_data.yaml for the actual dataset.

Here the result of the benchmark test on linux Optiplex system. The sorting is slightly more expensive as expected but negligible for the current dataset.
